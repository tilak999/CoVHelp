# CoVHelp

It was created to gather human and medical help for those who were in need.

This was hosted on `vercel` with `firebase` but can be hosted on any platform that can run node and you have to add your own firebase keys.


```sh
# Install packages
npm install

# Run web app
npm run start
```
